# ABANDONED Moxie_drive
A motor drive based off https://github.com/vedderb/bldc-hardware capable of 75v and 100a continuous for silly electric vehicles


MoxiE-Drive - high power  motor controller
=============

design:
12-60v
120-150 continuous phase amps
based off the vesc 6. has phase shunts

Forged from the remminants of the oppressed vesc 6.
Raised on a diet of endless sphere and equals zero posts.
destined for a fight to the death in hilariously brutal Power Wheels Racing Series.
I give to you, the MoxiE-Drive.

This the Hardware for my derivitive of the Vesc-project.
